# A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. 
# It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data
# that can be changed later in the program. For example, number = 10

x = 20
print(x)
print(type(x))

# init multple variable at a time
# multiple values to multiple variables

x, y, z = "Saurav", "Gaurav", "ABCD"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


x = y = z = "sabko ek value do"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
